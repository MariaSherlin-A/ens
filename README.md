# ENSplit

**A DeFi payment-splitting protocol where ENS names dynamically define how funds are split across multiple wallets at transaction time.**

## 🎯 What Is ENSplit?

ENSplit allows organizations to **send one payment to one ENS name**, and the funds are **automatically split across multiple recipients** based on live ENS records.

✅ **No smart contract redeployments**  
✅ **No changing frontend logic**  
✅ **No hard-coded wallet lists**  

**ENS controls where the money flows.**

---

## 🔥 The Problem It Solves

Organizations today face constant payment routing headaches:

- 🔄 **Changing contributor wallets**
- 💰 **Treasury + ops + tax splits**
- 🌍 **Regional payout differences**
- 📊 **Vendor + platform fee deductions**

Current solutions require:
- ❌ Custom scripts
- ❌ Manual calculations
- ❌ Multiple transactions
- ❌ Frequent contract updates

This causes:
- 💥 Errors
- 💸 Overpayments
- ⏰ Delays
- 📉 Accounting nightmares

---

## ✨ How ENSplit Solves This

Instead of hard-coding payout logic into contracts, **organizations define payout rules inside ENS records**.

### Example ENS Configuration

For `payments.company.eth`, set these text records:

```
split.wallet1 = 0x1234...
split.wallet1.percent = 40

split.wallet2 = 0x2345...
split.wallet2.percent = 35

split.wallet3 = 0x3456...
split.wallet3.percent = 20

split.treasury = 0x4567...
split.treasury.percent = 5
```

### When Funds Are Sent:

1. ✅ ENS is resolved live
2. ✅ Records are read on-chain
3. ✅ Funds are split automatically
4. ✅ Payments execute in one transaction

**Change the team? Update ENS. That's it.**

---

## 🏗️ Core Innovation

> **ENSplit turns ENS into a programmable payment router**, allowing organizations to update fund distribution logic without touching contracts or frontends, while still executing trustless DeFi transactions.

## 🧪 Testnet Configuration

This demo uses **Sepolia Testnet** with simulated ENS data. No real wallet connection or real ETH required.

### Pre-configured ENS Names:

1. **payments.company.eth**
   - 4 recipients
   - Corporate payment structure

2. **team.dao.eth**
   - 4 recipients
   - DAO treasury distribution

3. **freelance.eth**
   - 3 recipients
   - Freelancer + platform + tax split

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Configure a Split

1. Navigate to **Configure** page
2. Select an ENS name or create new
3. Add recipients with:
   - Name (identifier)
   - Wallet address
   - Percentage (must total 100%)
4. Preview the configuration
5. Save

### 2. Send a Payment

1. Navigate to **Send Payment** page
2. Select recipient ENS name
3. Enter amount in ETH
4. Review payment breakdown
5. Execute payment
6. View transaction confirmation

### 3. View History

1. Navigate to **History** page
2. See all past transactions
3. View split details
4. Check transaction hashes

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### ENS Integration

The application demonstrates proper ENS integration using:

- **ENS Resolution**: Converting ENS names to addresses
- **Text Record Reading**: Parsing split configurations from ENS
- **Live Updates**: Reading ENS data at transaction time
- **Validation**: Ensuring split percentages total 100%

### Payment Flow

```
User Input (ENS + Amount)
    ↓
Resolve ENS Name → Address
    ↓
Read ENS Text Records
    ↓
Parse Split Configuration
    ↓
Validate Percentages
    ↓
Calculate Individual Amounts
    ↓
Execute Split Payment
    ↓
Record Transaction
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with design tokens
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **ENS Simulation**: Custom TestENSProvider class
- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet (simulated)
